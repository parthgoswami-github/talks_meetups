# Red Hat Forum Asia Pacific 2020

- **Title**: Migrating iptables to nftables in RHEL8
- **YouTube Link**: TBA
- ** CFP Abstract**: The networking utility 'nftables' has been introduced in RHEL8. While many customers are using legacy iptables, 
                     which is deprecated in RHEL8, these customers are inquisitive to learn how to migrate the existing rules from iptables to nftables. 
                     The session was an attempt to throw some light on the migration.
